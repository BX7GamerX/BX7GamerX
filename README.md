Jenepher Translator - README

Description

This Python application, named Jenepher Translator, provides a simple and user-friendly interface for translating English verbs to their German counterparts and vice versa. It utilizes customtkinter, a custom Tkinter library, for the graphical user interface (GUI) elements.

Python 3.x (Make sure you have Python installed on your system)
customtkinter library: You can install it using pip install customtkinter

Using the Application

Enter an English or German verb in the text entry field.

Functionality

The application utilizes a built-in dictionary containing a list of common English and German verbs.
When the user enters a verb, the code searches through the dictionary and displays the corresponding translation if found.
If the entered word is not found in the dictionary, an appropriate message is displayed.
Possible Enhancements

Expand the dictionary to include more verbs.
Implement functionality to handle conjugated verbs, tenses, and verb phrases.
Integrate audio capabilities for pronunciation practice.

Disclaimer

This is a basic example and may not cover all possible verb translations. It's recommended to consult a comprehensive dictionary for more nuanced translations and grammatical variations.
